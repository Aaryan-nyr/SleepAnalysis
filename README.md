# Sleep Pattern Analysis: Predicting Sleep Score and Optimal Bedtime

## Overview
This project analyzes sleep patterns using machine learning techniques to predict sleep scores and determine an 
optimal bedtime range. The study is based on sleep data collected from the Sleep Cycle app and employs clustering and regression models to identify key sleep factors and trends.
# Objectives
- Predict a sleep score based on various features using machine learning.

- Identify the optimal bedtime for the subject.

- Explore the correlation between time in bed, external factors, and sleep quality.

- Investigate the impact of seasonal variations on sleep quality.

## Dataset
The dataset, sourced from Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/danagerous/sleep-data, consists of 887 sleep entries recorded between 2014-2018. Each entry includes the following features:
